class BlockSparseAttention(vFlow):
    r"""
    Block-sparse attention flow with centroid-based routing.

    This flow implements a simple **block-sparse routing** strategy
    inspired by the block-top-k routing used in Kinetics
    :cite:`sadhukhan2025kinetics` (arXiv:2506.05333). It maintains a
    per-request centroid over keys and uses query–centroid similarity to
    select a sparse set of pages.

    High-level behavior
    -------------------
    - During :meth:`forward_cache`, the flow computes a **centroid**
      vector for each request from its key cache ``cache["k"]`` and
      stores the result in ``cache["centroids"]`` with shape

      .. math::

          \text{cache["centroids"]} \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times 1 \times D},

      where :math:`B` is the number of requests and :math:`D` is the
      head dimension.

    - During :meth:`forward_indexer`, the flow:
      
      1. Averages query tokens per request to obtain a single
         **query summary** per request,
      2. Applies a generalized matrix–vector multiplication
         :class:`GeMV` between the query summaries and the cached
         centroids to obtain a scalar **score** for each (request, page),
      3. Uses :class:`topK` to convert these scores into sparse page
         indices ``o`` of shape

         .. math::

             o \in \mathbb{R}^{S} \times 1 \times 1},

         Here :math:`S` is the leading page axis. Internally it is a packed
         axis (often denoted :math:`S_{\mathrm{pack}}`), obtained by
         concatenating the pages from all requests. As a user, you can simply
         think of :math:`S` as "the number of pages for this request"; the
         vFlow kernels and :class:`ContextBase` will take care of mapping
         between per-request page counts and the packed layout automatically.

    Cache layout
    ------------
    This flow declares a single extra cache tensor via
    :meth:`create_cache`:

    .. code-block:: python

        {
            "centroids": (1, head_dim)
        }

    The runtime then also allocates ``"k"`` and ``"v"`` with inner shapes
    ``(page_size, head_dim)``. As per the :class:`vFlow` contract,
    each cache tensor has two logical views:

    - In :meth:`forward_indexer` (page-packed view):

      .. math::

          \text{cache["centroids"]} \sim
          \mathbb{R}^{S} \times 1 \times D},

    - In :meth:`forward_cache` (batch-major view):

      .. math::

          \text{cache["centroids"]} \sim
          \mathbb{R}^{B \times 1 \times D}.

    2. Take an elementwise maximum of these two products to form a
